# Called by the /forgeward:gate skill ONLY after every fired reviewer returned
# "<AXIS> VERDICT: PASS". Writes the HEAD-pinned PASS marker so it is repo-scoped
# and never committed. The marker stores the substantive-diff hash that the
# PreToolUse hook re-checks at push time.
#
# The marker is keyed by BRANCH under the repo's COMMON git dir
# (git rev-parse --git-common-dir), not the per-worktree --git-dir. The common dir
# is shared across every linked worktree, so a gate run inside a worktree writes a
# marker the push hook finds even when the push is evaluated from a different
# checkout of the same repo. This is what makes the gate worktree-safe; keying by
# branch keeps concurrent worktrees on different branches from clobbering each
# other's marker.

# --- GC: drop markers whose branch no longer exists ---------------------------
# Markers accumulate forever otherwise: one per branch ever gated, left behind by
# every merge-and-delete. Harmless (a dead branch's marker is never consulted, since
# lookup is keyed by the CURRENT branch) but unbounded, and it makes the directory
# useless for answering "what has been gated".
#
# Prune on write rather than behind a flag: a cleanup command nobody runs is not a
# cleanup. Deleting is fail-safe in the direction that matters — the worst outcome of
# a wrong deletion is one extra gate run, never a false PASS.
#
# Existence is checked against refs/heads, which lives in the COMMON git dir, so a
# branch checked out in ANOTHER linked worktree is correctly seen as alive and its
# marker survives. That is the case this must not fire on.
#
# BLIND SPOTS, stated so the limit is not mistaken for coverage:
#   - it cannot tell a branch deleted and later recreated under the same name from one
#     that was never gone, so such a marker survives. Deliberate: the staleness that
#     actually matters is content drift, and is_fresh() already re-checks the
#     substantive-diff hash on every push. This GC is disk hygiene, not freshness.
#   - on a DETACHED HEAD the branch reads as literal "HEAD", so that marker has no
#     refs/heads entry and a later run from a real branch sweeps it. Fail-safe in the
#     only direction that counts: it costs one re-gate, never a false PASS.
#   - `find -type f` stats without following links, so a SYMLINK sitting in the markers
#     directory is never seen by the sweep and never pruned. That is a completeness gap
#     in the cleanup, not a trust gap: GC only ever deletes, so an unpruned entry gains
#     nothing, and anyone able to plant one already has write access to the git dir and
#     could forge a marker outright. Left as-is rather than followed, because following
#     links is how a cleanup routine ends up deleting outside the directory it owns.
#   - CONCURRENT WRITES race. The live-branch snapshot and the batched delete are not
#     atomic, so if a second worktree creates and gates a branch inside that window,
#     this process's already-built delete list can remove that branch's just-written
#     marker. Demonstrated under an injected delay, not merely theorised. Same bounded
#     cost as the rest: one re-gate for that branch, never a false PASS, because the
#     push-time check re-validates the substantive-diff hash independently. Left
#     unfixed deliberately — locking a cleanup pass to close a window this narrow buys
#     less than the failure modes a lock introduces.
