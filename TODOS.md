# TODOS

Deferred engineering work for forgeward-gate, grouped by component then priority
(P0 highest → P4). `DECISIONS.md` remains the source of truth for *why* a design
is the way it is; this file tracks what is still owed. Items carry the source
that raised them and the date.

Every item here was raised in a merged PR body or a review round. PR bodies are
write-once and effectively gone after merge, which is why they live here now.

## Gate — test suite

- **`test/gate-test.sh` assertion "dep add re-gate denied" (S7, `test/gate-test.sh:398`)
  intermittently FAILS OPEN — it allowed a push that should have been denied.** Seen
  twice inside one ~5-minute window while building 0.7.2, then not once in 22+
  consecutive runs since. The failure direction is what makes this worth a P1: the
  companion assertion on the same line pair (`dependency added -> hash CHANGED`)
  passed both times, so the hash genuinely changed and the hook allowed the push
  anyway. If that reflects real hook behaviour rather than a test artifact, it is a
  false PASS — the exact class the pre-push hook exists to prevent.

  Not attributed, and deliberately not claimed as pre-existing. What was ruled out:
  the assertion and its fixture are untouched by 0.7.2 and run before every line this
  release adds; `forgeward-gate-check.sh` never invokes `forgeward-detect-base.sh`, so
  half the release cannot reach it; an isolated replay of the exact S5→S7 sequence was
  clean 15/15; the suite was clean 6/6 with the 0.7.1 `diff-hash` swapped in and 6/6
  with the 0.7.2 one, i.e. the swap did not move it; and 4 suites run concurrently were
  clean 4/4, so it is not the obvious load sensitivity.

  Master was then run 17 times and was clean 17/17. Read that carefully rather than as
  an acquittal: at the observed ~8% rate, 17 clean runs still has a ~24% chance of
  happening anyway, so it lowers the odds that master shares the flake without
  excluding it. Against that, the mechanism argues the other way — in the `S7` fixture
  repo there is no `.claude-plugin/`, so 0.7.2's `diff-hash` change is provably a
  no-op there (V4 pins byte-identical output), and a fail-OPEN requires the recomputed
  hash to MATCH a stale marker, which nothing in this release can produce. Two data
  points, wide error bars, and a mechanism that does not fit. Unresolved on purpose.

  Next step for whoever picks this up: instrument S7 to dump the marker, both hashes
  and the raw hook output on failure, and leave the suite looping. An instrumented
  copy must live inside the repo tree or set `PLUGIN` explicitly — the suite derives
  `PLUGIN` from `BASH_SOURCE`, so a copy in /tmp silently reviews the wrong scripts.
  (surfaced while building 0.7.2, 2026-08-03) **Priority:** P1

## Gate — publish matcher

- **`git push origin --delete <branch>` is denied when the current branch has no
  marker.** Deleting a ref is still a push, and the matcher deliberately does not
  parse command structure, so it cannot tell a ref deletion from a code publish.
  Hit for real on 2026-08-03 cleaning up two merged branches. Workaround needing
  no code change: `gh api -X DELETE repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/refs/heads/<branch>`,
  which carries none of the matcher's verbs, then `git fetch origin --prune`.
  A fix means distinguishing `--delete` and `:refspec` from a code push — i.e.
  parsing flags and refspecs, the structural modeling `DECISIONS.md` calls a dead
  end after three failed rounds. Undecided whether the friction is worth it.
  (checkpoint item 3, 2026-08-02; confirmed live 2026-08-03) **Priority:** P3
- **Five disclosed under-matches remain by design**, pinned in test A4 so a
  behavior change fails the suite rather than quietly outdating the comment:
  the shell-wrapper family (`bash -c 'git push'`, eval/ssh/trap — the one genuine
  coverage reduction vs the old substring), the quoted command word (`'git' push`,
  `git pu''sh` — the latter defeats even the pre-filter), the synthesized separator
  (`git${IFS}push`), `git -C <path> push`, and indirection through a variable,
  alias, function or script. All pre-existing; the old bare substring missed every
  one. Not fixable without command-position analysis, which the file header calls
  a dead end. Kept here to record the decision, not as work. (PR #9, 2026-08-02)

## Gate — base detection and freshness

- **`forgeward-diff-hash.sh` produces a DIFFERENT hash under `jq` than under the
  `python3` fallback**, because `jq -S` pretty-prints while `json.dumps` uses
  compact separators, so the two canonical snapshots are different bytes. A marker
  written on a machine with `jq` reads as stale on one without it (and vice versa),
  forcing a spurious re-gate. Pre-existing and fail-safe — it can only cause an
  extra gate run, never a false PASS — and confirmed present in the pre-0.7.2
  script too, so 0.7.2 neither introduced nor worsened it. Not folded into 0.7.2:
  aligning the two would change the hash for every repo, which is a one-time global
  re-gate and deserves its own PR. (surfaced while building 0.7.2, 2026-08-03)
  **Priority:** P2
- **The drive-letter arm in `remote_is_networked()` approximates git's third
  locality clause and diverges on DOS reserved device names.** git's real predicate is
  `!colon || (slash && slash < colon) || (has_dos_drive_prefix() && is_valid_path())`.
  The first two clauses are encoded exactly; the third is approximated by
  `[A-Za-z]:[/\\]*` gated on `uname -s`. On a native Windows build with the default
  `core.protectNTFS=true`, `is_valid_win32_path()` rejects a segment named for a DOS
  device (`aux`, `con`, `nul`, `com1`-`9`, `lpt1`-`9`) or ending in a space or period,
  so git dials SSH to a one-letter host while the pattern here says local — the
  dangerous direction. Needs native-Windows git plus a remote path with a literal
  device segment, which no GitHub/GHE/gitolite/gitea host produces and an attacker
  could only arrange by already owning `.git/config`. Not closed because the true
  clause depends on `core.protectNTFS` and the NTFS reserved-name table, neither
  reachable from bash without the Win32 API. Untested for the same reason: the B14
  table has no row for `X:/<dos-device>/…` because its correct answer depends on a
  config value the suite cannot read. (security review round 4, 2026-08-03)
  **Priority:** P3
- **The Windows half of B14's drive-letter assertion only runs on Windows.** The
  `uname -s` branch at `test/gate-test.sh` means a machine that is not MINGW/MSYS/CYGWIN
  silently takes the other expectation, so "a drive path is local on Windows" has no
  coverage unless someone actually runs the suite under Git Bash. That is done by hand
  before each release here and both legs were run for 0.7.2, but nothing enforces it.
  (security review round 4, 2026-08-03) **Priority:** P3
- **`forgeward-detect-base.sh` never runs `git fetch`**, so `origin/<base>` is only
  as current as your last fetch — the same class of error one level up, and
  structurally invisible from inside the script. It also infers the base from repo
  defaults, so it cannot know a PR targets a release branch or is stacked on
  another feature branch. Stated as a blind spot in the script header and
  `skills/gate/SKILL.md`; recorded here so the limit is not mistaken for coverage.
  (PR #6, 2026-08-01) **Priority:** —

## Reviewers

- **PR #4's two security rules were verified one run per fixture**, which shows the
  rules *can* fire reliably, not that they always will. Five fixtures, each a real
  git repo reviewed end to end, all passed — but repeated-run reliability is
  unestablished. (PR #4 "Not verified", 2026-07-21) **Priority:** P3
- **Route postures are capped on purpose.** A `paywalled`/metered posture (it needs
  its own specialist rulebook, and half-implementing it is worse than not claiming
  it) and an "indexed but no OG tags" posture (on an indexed site missing OG is a
  defect, already Medium/Low) were both excluded deliberately — each posture added
  is another chance to misclassify. Recorded as a decision, not work.
  (PR #5 "Deliberately excluded", 2026-07-23) **Priority:** —
- **The per-tool exemption in `forgeward-scan.sh` trusts `basename "$tool"`**, so an
  executable *named* `grype` that isn't grype inherits grype's `-o` overloading.
  Accepted as a documented limit rather than fixed: the wrapper runs `"$tool" "$@"`,
  so anyone able to plant that executable already has code execution here, making
  the file-write strictly weaker than what they already hold. Probing `--version`
  would not close it — a spoofed binary can print anything. In the script header as
  a blind spot. (PR #6, sixth security pass, 2026-08-01) **Priority:** —

## ci-gate

- **The end-to-end gated-e2e chain is not proven in one continuous run.** All three
  legs are individually verified — gate pattern proven in real CI, the skill
  generates that exact pattern (equivalence-verified byte-for-byte), and
  activate-and-run-green confirmed on a real Actions run. What remains is
  "skill emits the job on a never-touched case-2 repo and it goes green" in a
  single chain, which awaits a fresh case-2 repo; none exists in the fleet
  (nutriloop, the only hosted-public repo, was hand-tuned). Already disclosed in
  `README.md:186`. Blocked externally, not by code. (PR #1, 2026-06-25; inherited
  by `ci-gate` via `5d676ba`) **Priority:** P3

## Enforcement boundary

- **The local gate is strong, not indestructible, and this is by design.**
  `git push --no-verify` skips the pre-push hook; the marker is a local file that
  can be forged; git hooks are not cloned, so the hook needs re-installing per
  clone and after a plugin update. No purely-local gate escapes these. The
  unbypassable boundary is the server-side `/forgeward:ci-gate` (required checks +
  branch protection), which ships. Recorded so the residual is not rediscovered as
  a bug. (PR #2, 2026-07-16) **Priority:** —
- **The PreToolUse artifact deny only protects once installed.** Hooks run from the
  installed plugin cache, not a working tree, so a guard in an unreleased version
  does nothing until that version is installed — verified the hard way when the
  first probe of a new guard came back "not denied" because the live hook was the
  previous build. Layers 1, 3 and 4 need no install. (PR #6, 2026-08-01)
  **Priority:** —

## Housekeeping

- **Local tag `item2-wip-quote-stripping`** preserves the third failed attempt at
  the publish matcher (quote-stripping via bash extglob — correct but superlinear
  in quote density, 63s on 3KB of quote-dense input). Superseded by the 0.7.1
  awk-based design. Decide whether to keep it as an archaeological record or drop
  it. (PR #8, 2026-08-01) **Priority:** P4
- **The three merged PR bodies #1, #2 and #3 carry a `🤖 Generated with Claude Code`
  byline.** Cosmetic and historical; noted only so it is a deliberate choice to
  leave them rather than an oversight. Newer PRs do not carry it.
  (observed 2026-08-03) **Priority:** P4

## Completed

- **`forgeward-detect-base.sh` paid a `gh repo view` network call on every run.**
  Fixed in 0.7.2: step 1 is guarded on a remote carrying a network URL, so scratch
  repos with no remote or a filesystem-path remote skip it. A short-circuit, not a
  reorder — with a real remote the call still fires first and still wins. Suite time
  on the same 104 assertions, three runs each: unguarded 114s / 201s / 93s, guarded
  29s / 33s / 37s. B14's five assertions pin both directions, including the positive
  control that a networked remote still reaches `gh`, and the suite makes no real
  network call at all now (a stub `gh` answers). (2026-08-03)
- **`forgeward-diff-hash.sh` neutralized the version field in root `package.json`
  only, so every plugin release forced a spurious re-gate.** Fixed in 0.7.2: the
  canonical-snapshot treatment now covers `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (top-level
  `.version`) and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (nested `.plugins[].version`),
  in both the `jq` and `python3` branches. Neutralization is targeted, never
  recursive, so an npm `overrides` entry nesting a `{"version": ...}` object cannot
  hide a dependency pin change. The extra payload sections are appended only when
  the files exist, so a repo with no `.claude-plugin/` hashes byte-identically to
  before and its markers survive the upgrade (pinned by V4). (2026-08-03)
- **Publish matcher over-denied on merely-mentioned commands.** Deferred explicitly
  in PR #6, PR #7 and PR #8 before landing. Fixed in PR #9 (0.7.1) by deciding
  MENTIONED vs ISSUED by quoting rather than substring: quoted spans are blanked
  and the plain test runs on the remainder. Four earlier attempts failed; the
  fourth's three consecutive command-substitution desyncs are why substitutions are
  now distrusted rather than parsed. 94 gate + 14 pre-push green on WSL and Windows
  Git Bash. (2026-08-02)
- **Gate markers accumulated forever, one per branch ever gated.** Fixed in PR #8
  (0.7.0): pruned on marker write, checked against `refs/heads` under the common git
  dir so a branch live in another worktree keeps its marker. 11s → 238ms on 1000
  dead markers. (2026-08-01)
- **Orphaned marker `fix/publish-matcher-quoting.json` pruned by hand.** `gc_markers`
  runs only on the marker-*write* path, so an orphan on a clean `master` never
  self-clears — there is no gate run to trigger it. (2026-08-03)
- **Two stale remote branches deleted** — `feat/route-posture-classification` and
  `feat/security-reviewer-redefinition-toctou`. Both squash-merged (as #5 and #4),
  patch-ids identical to their master twins, zero unique content. Deleted via
  `gh api`; SHAs `6cfdea6` and `31ca190` recorded in case either is ever needed.
